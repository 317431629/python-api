This is the official API that is maintained by Shotgun Software (support@shotgunsoftware.com)\r\n\r\n## Minimum Requirements\r\n \r\n* Shotgun server v2.4.12 or higher. (Earlier builds of 2.4 will work, but have buggy support for float field types)\r\n* Python v2.4 - v2.7. (We do have plans to eventually support Python 3)\r\n\r\n## High Performance Requirements\r\n\r\n* For Python 2.4 and 2.5, install simplejson 2.0.9: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.0.9\r\n* For Python 2.6 and higher, install simplejson 2.1.6: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.1.6\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nTo use Shotgun's Python API module, you need to place the package shotgun_api3 in one of the directories specified by the environment variable PYTHONPATH. For more information on PYTHONPATH and using modules in Python, see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nTutorials and detailed documentation about the Python API are available on the [Python API Wiki](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki). There is also some additional related documentation on the [Shotgun Support Website](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/forums/48807-developer-api-info).\r\nSome useful direct links in each are below:\r\n\r\n* [Introduction and Video Tour](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/entries/38181-api-introduction-video-tour)  \r\n* [Reference: Methods](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Methods)\r\n* [Reference: Data Types](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Data-Types)\r\n* [Reference: Filter Syntax](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/wiki/Reference%3A-Filter-Syntax)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nIntegration and unit tests are provided.\r\n- test_client and tests_unit mock server interaction and do not require a shotgun instance to be available.\r\n- test_api and test_api_long do require a shotgun instance, with a script key available for the tests. These tests rely on a tests/config file, which can be created by renaming example_config and supplying the server and script user values. The tests will set up test data on the server based on the data set forth in the config. This data will be manipulated by the tests, and should not be used for other purposes.\r\n- To run all of the tests, use the shell script run-tests. This script require nose to be installed.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nThe latest changes can be seen in the latest [README file](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api/blob/master/README.mdown)","tagline":"Shotgun Python API","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
